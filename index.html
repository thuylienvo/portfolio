            Howdy! My name is, Mimi Vo. I was original born in Autun, France, and moved to states when I was about 4 years old. Currently, I am located in beautiful Austin, TX where I work as an Implementation Specialist for Experian Partner Solutions. I am taking the UT boot camp in order to gain new skills to be more proficient in my role and in hopes to become a web developer. Thank you MySpace for introducing me to my first set of code!
            <br>
            <br>
            In my spare time, you'll find me hanging out with family at the local park, dining at some new hot spot, reading a thriller, watching some binge-able shows and baking. My creative outlet is managing a small macaron side business where I get to spill my passion for food into little sugar treats (as shown in image above).
